//! This is a **fork** of the [rustc-llvm-proxy](https://github.com/denzp/rustc-llvm-proxy) crate.
//!
//! Dynamically proxy LLVM calls into Rust own shared library! ðŸŽ‰
//!
//! ## Use cases
//! Normally there is no much need for the crate, except a couple of exotic cases:
//!
//! * Your crate is some kind build process helper that leverages LLVM (e.g. [bpf-linker](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker)),
//! * Your crate needs to stay up to date with Rust LLVM version (again [bpf-linker](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker)),
//! * You would prefer not to have dependencies on host LLVM libs (as always [bpf-linker](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker)).
//!
//! ## Usage
//! First, you need to make sure no other crate links your binary against system LLVM library.
//! In case you are using `llvm-sys`, this can be achieved with a special feature:
//!
//! ``` toml
//! [dependencies.llvm-sys]
//! version = "70"
//! features = ["no-llvm-linking"]
//! ```
//!
//! Then all you need to do is to include the crate into your project:
//!
//! ``` toml
//! [dependencies]
//! rustc-llvm-proxy = "0.4"
//! ```
//!
//! ``` rust
//! extern crate aya_rustc_llvm_proxy;
//! ```
